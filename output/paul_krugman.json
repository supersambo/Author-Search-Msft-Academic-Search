Using new tools--in particular, modeling techniques developed to analyze industrial organization, international trade, and economic growth--this \\\"new economic geography\\\" has emerged as one of the most exciting areas of contemporary economics. The authors show how seemingly disparate models reflect a few basic themes, and in so doing they develop a common \\\"grammar\\\" for discussing a variety of issues. They show how a common approach that emphasizes the three-way interaction among increasing returns, transportation costs, and the movement of productive factors can be applied to a wide range of issues in urban, regional, and international economics.

Emergence of a core-periphery pattern depends on transportation costs, economies of scale, and the share of manufacturing in national income. The study of economic geography-of the location of factors of production in space-occupies a relatively small part of standard economic analysis. International trade theory, in particular, conventionally treats nations as dimensionless points (and frequently assumes zero transportation costs between countries as well). Admittedly, models descended from von Thunen (1826) play an important role in urban studies, while Hotelling-type models of locational competition get a reasonable degree of attention in industrial organization. On the whole, however, it seems fair to say that the study of economic geography plays at best a marginal role in economic theory. On the face of it, this neglect is surprising. The facts of economic geography are surely among the most striking features of real-world economies, at least to laymen. For example, one of the most remarkable things about the United States is that in a generally sparsely populated country, much of whose land is fertile, the bulk of the population resides in a few clusters of metropolitan areas; a quarter of the inhabitants are crowded into a not especially inviting section of the East Coast.

Consequently, integration need not lead to falling tax rates, and might well be consistent with the maintenance of large welfare states. \\\"Limit taxing\\\" also means that simple tax harmonization – adoption of a common tax rate – always harms at least one nation and adoption of a rate between the two unharmonized rates harms both nations.

It differs from traditional work in economic geography mainly in adopting a modelling strategy that exploits the same technical tricks that have played such a large role in the 'new trade' and 'new growth' theories; these modelling tricks, while they preclude any claims of generality, do allow the construction of models that--unlike most traditional spatial analysis--are fully general-equilibrium and clearly derive aggregate behaviour from individual maximization. The new work is highly suggestive, particularly in indicating how historical accident can shape economic geography, and how gradual changes in underlying parameters can produce discontinuous change in spatial structure. It also serves the important purpose of placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream.

In fact, most of this increase has been in skill intensive goods such as computers, so that one would expect little additional impact on U.S. relative wages. However, developing countries appear to be specializing in unskilled labor-intensive niches within these industries. If so, the effect on wage inequality could still be significant. The paper develops a model and a numerical example showing that when developing countries can take over the unskilled labor-intensive portions of vertically specialized indus tries, the consequences can closely resemble the textbook effect.

This paper will argue that the critique in fact misses the point, essentially because the critics undertake the wrong thought experiments. Trade volumes are not irrelevant: if one poses the question correctly, one immediately realizes that small trade volumes are inconsistent with a story that attributes large distributional effects to trade. The factor bias of technological change is not immaterial, except in the case where such change takes place in a small open economy (as opposed to one that can affect world prices), and where technical change occurs only in that economy (rather than occurring simultaneously in other economies as well); since the real situation does not meet either criterion, factor bias definitely does matter. Most surprisingly, the much maligned use of a factor content approach to infer the effects of trade on factor prices turns out to be an entirely justified procedure when carefully applied. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is much less clear, however, whether this 'crisis' will produce macroeconomic problems.\\\" Copyright (c) CEPR, CES, MSH, 2007.\",\"S\":[{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=1007836\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://www.sfu.ca/~kkasa/Krugman_07.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://www.eco.uc3m.es/~desmet/trade/Krugman2006.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~bodnarg/courses/readings/krugman.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/ecop_183.pdf?abstractid=1007836&mirid=1\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4502205\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://www.borsari.it/Paper%20-%20Krugman%20-%20Will%20there%20be%20a%20dollar%20crisis(2007).pdf\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://econ.ucdenver.edu/beckman/finance/krugman-wiley.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1007836\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://economicpolicy.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/51/436\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/wiley/will-there-be-a-dollar-crisis-n1mwSRI0Fa\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ecpoli/v22y2007ip435-467.html\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0327.2007.00183.x\"},{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1007836\"}],\"VFN\":\"Economic Policy\",\"V\":22,\"I\":51,\"FP\":436,\"LP\":467,\"DOI\":\"10.1111/j.1468-0327.2007.00183.x\"}","AA":[{"AuN":"paul krugman","AuId":2012377754,"AfN":"princeton university"}],"F":[{"FN":"external debt"},{"FN":"current account"},{"FN":"actuarial science"},{"FN":"financial economics"},{"FN":"macroeconomics"},{"FN":"finance"},{"FN":"economy"},{"FN":"economics"}]},

Both industries are imperfectly competitive and produce goods which are used in final consumption and as intermediates by firms in the same industry. Intermediate usage creates cost and demand linkages between firms and a tendency for agglomeration of each industry. When trade barriers are high the equilibrium involves division of both industries between both locations in order to meet the final demands of consumers. At lower trade barriers agglomeration forces dominate and the equilibrium involves specialization, with each industry concentrated in a single location.

If the country is unable to meet its debt service requirements out of current income, the creditors have two choices. They can finance the country, lending at an expected loss in the hope that the country will eventually be able to repay its debt after all; or they can forgive, reducing the debt level to one that the country can repay. The post-1983 debt strategy of the IMF and the US has relied on financing, but many current calls for debt reform call for forgiveness instead. The paper shows that the choice between financing and forgiveness represents a tradeoff. Financing gives the creditors an option value: if the country turns out to do relatively well, creditors will not have written down their claims unnecessarily. However, the burden of debt distorts the country's incentives, since the benefits of good performance go largely to creditors rather than itself. The paper also shows that the tradeoff itself can be improved if both financing and forgiveness are made contingent on states of nature that the country cannot affect, such as oil prices, world interest rates, etc. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)\",\"S\":[{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w2486.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=978416\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304387888900442\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w2486\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=978416\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeedeveco/v_3a29_3ay_3a1988_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a253-268.htm\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v29y1988i3p253-268.html\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://econ.washington.edu/user/yuchin/472s/readings/krugman.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VBV-45MFRNW-2G/2/51d0f7c7a53d4f90dd0bbe0c0a510dee\"},{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=978416&rec=1&srcabs=305569&alg=7&pos=3\"}],\"VFN\":\"Journal of Development Economics\",\"V\":29,\"I\":3,\"FP\":253,\"LP\":268,\"DOI\":\"10.1016/0304-3878(88)90044-2\"}","AA":[{"AuN":"paul krugman","AuId":2012377754}],"F":[{"FN":"internal debt"},{"FN":"debt levels and flows"},{"FN":"debt to gdp ratio"},{"FN":"senior debt"},{"FN":"recourse debt"},{"FN":"external debt"},{"FN":"interest rate"},{"FN":"developing country"},{"FN":"actuarial science"},{"FN":"macroeconomics"},{"FN":"finance"},{"FN":"international trade"},{"FN":"economic policy"},{"FN":"microeconomics"},{"FN":"economic growth"},{"FN":"economics"}]},

Since the answer to this question suggests when there will be more than one town in the isolated state, it is hoped the present model will lead to the development of a general equilibrium model of urban systems.\",\"S\":[{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://www.mori.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/teaching/lectures/agglomeration_2012/Agglomeration_2012_10(Fujita-Krugman-95).pdf\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016604629502098F\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:regeco:v:25:y:1995:i:4:p:505-528\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/regeco/v25y1995i4p505-528.html\"},{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"http://www.elsevier.com/framework_aboutus/pdfs/When_is_the_economy_monocentric.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/b6v89-3yf4bmt-m/2/0f97b425b59c32e8882ac79a3a610212\"}],\"VFN\":\"Regional Science and Urban Economics\",\"V\":25,\"I\":4,\"FP\":505,\"LP\":528,\"DOI\":\"10.1016/0166-0462(95)02098-F\"}","AA":[{"AuN":"masahisa fujita","AuId":2225182311,"AfN":"university of pennsylvania"},{"AuN":"paul krugman","AuId":2012377754,"AfN":"stanford university"}],"F":[{"FN":"monopolistic competition"},{"FN":"general equilibrium theory"},{"FN":"mathematical economics"},{"FN":"macroeconomics"},{"FN":"economy"},{"FN":"microeconomics"},{"FN":"economics"}]},

This article argues that some important insights into urban concentration, especially the tendency of some developing countries to have very large primate cities, can be derived from recent approaches to economic geography. Three approaches are compared: the well-established neoclassical urban systems theory, which emphasizes the tradeoff between agglomeration economies and diseconomies of city size; the new economic geography, which attempts to derive agglomeration effects from the interactions among market size, transportation costs, and increasing returns at the firm level; and a nihilistic view that cities emerge out of a random process in which there are roughly constant returns to city size. The article suggests that Washington consensus policies of reduced government intervention and trade opening may tend to reduce the size of primate cities or at least slow their relative growth.\",\"S\":[{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/wbdevecon94/247-283.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://irx.sagepub.com/content/19/1-2/5.abstract\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:sae:inrsre:v:19:y:1996:i:1-2:p:5-30\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=554713\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/inrsre/v19y1996i1-2p5-30.html\"}],\"VFN\":\"International Regional Science Review\",\"V\":19,\"FP\":5,\"LP\":30,\"DOI\":\"10.1177/016001769601900202\"}","AA":[{"AuN":"paul krugman","AuId":2012377754,"AfN":"stanford university"}],"F":[{"FN":"economies of agglomeration"},{"FN":"developing country"},{"FN":"urban geography"},{"FN":"stochastic process"},{"FN":"international trade"},{"FN":"economy"},{"FN":"economic growth"},{"FN":"economics"}]},

Moreover, if current asset valuations represent rational expectations, simple arithmetic shows that it is almost impossible for past rates of return to continue through a growth slowdown.

This volume looks at the experience of specific industries in order to determine the effectiveness of strategic trade policy in promoting economic growth.

This new programme of research also covers switches in exchange rate regimes. This volume from the Centre for economic Policy Research and the National Bureau of Economic Research includes contributions - as authors or discussants - from most of the active participants in the development of this new field, and will serve as a useful introduction and basic text for this new research programme. It opens with an account of the basic economic model of a currency band developed by Paul Krugman, which is followed by two papers that extend this approach. Other chapters study the regime switches entailed in Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 and the preannounced entry of a floating currency into a band such as the EMS.

In practice, VAT systems exempt broad classes of consumer goods and services. This has important implications for the effect of the VAT on international trade. A value added tax is sometimes advocated as a way of improving a country's international competitiveness because GATT rules permit the tax to be levied on imports and rebated on exports. This leads to political support for the VAT among exporters and producers of import-competing products. For a general VAT on all consumption, this argument is incorrect except in the very short run because exchange rates or domestic prices adjust to offset the effect of the tax on the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods. When prices or exchange rates have adjusted, a general value added tax will have no effect on imports and exports. In practice, the value added tax frequently exempts housing and many personal services. The VAT thus raises the price of tradeables relative to nontradeables and induces a substitution of housing and services for tradeable goods.

Current empirical estimafes suggest that problem debtors are in a very flat region of the debt Laffer curve where large changes in face value of debf have only small effcts in expected payments. The paper then considers a variety of market-based debt reduction schemes.

As long as the U.S. national saving rate remains far below that of all our major competitor nations, there is little chance for restoring America's international economic position.\",\"S\":[{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/awweb/awarchive?type=file&item=53075\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/241/4863/299.full.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/241/4863/299.short\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17734859\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/241/4863/299\"},{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988Sci...241..299H\"},{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.241.4863.299\"}],\"VFN\":\"Science\",\"V\":241,\"I\":4863,\"FP\":299,\"LP\":307,\"DOI\":\"10.1126/science.241.4863.299\"}","AA":[{"AuN":"george n hatsopoulos","AuId":2315471207,"AfN":"thermo electron"},{"AuN":"paul krugman","AuId":2012377754,"AfN":"massachusetts institute of technology"},{"AuN":"lawrence h summers","AuId":2159466601,"AfN":"harvard university"}],"F":[{"FN":"trade barrier"},{"FN":"standard of living"},{"FN":"cost of capital"},{"FN":"international trade"}]},

When such a change occurs, leading nations may have no incentive to adopt the new ideas; given their extensive experience with older technologies, the new ideas do not initially seem to be an improvement. Lagging nations, however, have less experience; the new techniques offer them an opportunity to use their lower wages, to break into the market.

Several years of extremely favorable U.S. economic performance, all the more dramatic in contrast to some of the crises and setbacks elsewhere, have made it seem possible that American supremacy, far from being further eroded, will return to something like its early post-World War II levels. But can America really stay on top? To raise this question is not in any sense to accept the idea that the world economy is a zero-sum game; if America does well, this is not bad news for the rest of the world, nor is a renewed supremacy based on dismal performance elsewhere good for us.

In fact shifts in demand and real exchange rate adjustment are necessary couplets, not substitutes. The essential reason for this complementarity is that a much higher fraction of a marginal dollar of US than of foreign spending falls on US output. As a result, a redistribution of world spending away from the US leads to an excess supply of US goods unless accompanied by a decline in their relative price. Although some economists believe that the integration of world capital markets somehow eliminates this problem, this is a fallacy that confuses accounting identities with behavior.

Over the longer term, however, the endogenous response of investment, together with increasing returns, may well actually increase real earnings. If immigration itself is not wholly exogenous, but respond to real wages, they may be multiple equilibria, that is, optimism or pessimism about the success of the economy at absorbing immigrants may constitute a self-fulfilling prophecy. Since World War II, a number of countries have experienced surges of politically motivated immigration. Examples include West Germany during the early postwar years, which was the destination of millions of refugees from the East; Portugal, faced during the mid-1970s with the return of several hundred thousand citizens from its newly independent African colonies; and Israel, which absorbed a massive wave of immigrants in the years following independence and has recent? ly received a new surge of immigration from the former Soviet Union. Such waves of immigration often present considerable short-run economic dif? ficulties, leading to some mix of upward pressure on unemployment and downward pressure on real wages. Nonetheless, over the longer run it is arguable that immigration not only brings considerable benefits, it may well tend to raise real wages. The problem is one of getting through the transition. The purpose of this paper is to offer a simple model that is suggestive of the mix of difficulties and opportunity presented by large-scale immigration. It shows why immigration may well have a negative effect on real wages in the short run but a positive effect in the long run. It also suggests the possibility that the out? come of waves of immigration is not predetermined: the question of whether the immigrants are successfully absorbed may depend crucially on both policy and expectations.\",\"S\":[{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=226766\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w4563.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/nber_w4563.pdf?abstractid=226766&mirid=1&type=2\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/20007492\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FPL00003829.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FPL00003829.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w4563\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/nber_w4563.pdf?abstractid=226766&mirid=2\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/4563.html\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elise_Brezis/publication/24059553_Immigration_investment_and_real_wages/links/0deec51eccf1f1e488000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:nbr:nberwo:4563\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://econ.biu.ac.il/files/economics/shared/staff/u46/brezis-migration-jpop-ec-1996.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.2307/20007492.pdf\"}]}","AA":[{"AuN":"elise s brezis","AuId":2218750326},{"AuN":"paul krugman","AuId":2012377754}],"F":[{"FN":"labour economics"},{"FN":"economy"},{"FN":"economic growth"},{"FN":"economics"}]},

The spatial economy is, self-evidently, a self-organizing system characterized by path dependence; it is a domain in which the interaction of individual decisions produces unexpected emergent behavior at the aggregate level; its dynamic landscapes are typically rugged, and the evolution of the spatial economy typically involves \\\"punctuated equilibria,\\\" in which gradual change in the driving variables leads to occasional discontinuous change in the resulting behavior. And in economic geography, as in many physical sciences, there are puzzling empirical regularities--like the startlingly simple law that describes city sizes--which seem to imply higher level principles at work. There is a long intellectual tradition in economic geography (or rather several separate but convergent traditions). The last few years have, however, seen a considerable acceleration of work, especially in the development of theoretical models of the emergence of spatial structure. This paper is a brief but I hope suggestive survey of this work, intended to convey a flavor of the exciting ideas being developed without going into technical detail. The paper is in five parts.

Moreover, split-the-difference tax harmonization can make both nations worse off. This may help explain why tax harmonisation which is Pareto improving in the standard model is so difficult in the real world. The key theoretical insight is that agglomeration forces create quasi-rents that can be taxed without inducing delocation. This suggests that the tax game is something subtler than a race to the bottom. Advanced 'core' nations may act like limit-pricing monopolists toward less advanced 'periphery' countries. Since agglomeration rents are a bell-shaped function of the level of integration, the equilibrium tax gap in our tax game is also bell shaped.\",\"S\":[{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/9290.html\"}]}","AA":[{"AuN":"richard baldwin","AuId":2421304513},{"AuN":"paul krugman","AuId":2012377754}],"F":[{"FN":"indirect tax"},{"FN":"double taxation"},{"FN":"international taxation"},{"FN":"value added tax"},{"FN":"tax reform"},{"FN":"public economics"},{"FN":"industrial organization"},{"FN":"international trade"},{"FN":"economics"}]},

Mi propio trabajo sobre la relacion entre la organizacion industrial y el comercio internacional co menzo en 1977, cuando empezaba mi carrera docente en la Universidad de Yale. En esa epoca, algunos de mis colegas pensaban que esta linea de investigacion tenia un valor y un interes dudosos; y en ocasiones, yo mismo me preguntaba si valdria la pena el intento. Afortunadamente, Carlos era mi colega y amigo. El sirvio como una caja de resonancia para mis ideas, expresadas con deficiencia al inicio, y me alento cuando mi trabajo tropezo con escasa aceptacion externa. Si no hubiese contado con el apoyo de unos cuantos colegas cercanos, entre quienes destacaba Carlos, sin duda habria abandonado un esfuerzo que al final me ha dado mas de lo que merezco. Todos conocemos la obra publicada por Diaz Alejandro con su propio nombre; tambien debemos otorgarle una parte importante del credito por la obra que alento en economistas mas jovenes. En cierto sentido, me temo que las \\\"nuevas\\\" teorias del comercio y la inversion internacionales hayan frustrado hasta ahora las expectati vas de Carlos. Desde el principio insistio en que la nueva teoria se apli cara a los problemas de comercio de los paises menos desarrollados. Sin embargo, los resultados de la investigacion sugieren a menudo que la teoria se aplica solo a los problemas de los paises avanzados. La primera generacion de modelos del comercio internacional basados en el insumo producto, la bibliografia del comercio intraindustrial, llevaron a la con clusion aparente de que el comercio no tradicional, basado en las eco nomias de escala, mas bien que en la ventaja comparativa, solo sera prominente entre economias similares. Esto implicaria que la nueva teo ria se aplica al comercio Norte-Norte, pero que el comercio Norte-Sur puede continuar analizandose con metodos tradicionales. [Como ha sub rayado Stewart (1984), los nuevos metodos son tambien importantes para el comercio Sur-Sur; mas adelante me ocupare de nuevo de este punto.

It describes the integrated-economy approach to international trade. It is common in the expositions of the international trade theory to start by imagining two isolated countries, which then are allowed to begin trade with each other. The integrated economy approach goes in the reverse direction, starting from a unified economy and then breaking it up. Using the integrated economy approach, it can be shown that the details of particular monopolistic competition models of trade, such as the form of product differentiation, do not matter when it comes to the description of the motives for and pattern of trade. In addition, a picture of trade can be easily offered in which both economies of scale and comparative advantage are the motives for trade. The chapter presents a restatement of the integrated-economy approach to the trade theory and presents a survey of other developments that cannot be treated within that approach. It also discusses the achievements and limits of the new trade theory.\",\"S\":[{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573440405800048\"}],\"VFN\":\"Handbook of International Economics\",\"V\":3,\"FP\":1243,\"LP\":1277,\"DOI\":\"10.1016/S1573-4404(05)80004-8\"}","AA":[{"AuN":"paul krugman","AuId":2492018870}],"F":[{"FN":"international free trade agreement"},{"FN":"international trade and water"},{"FN":"trade barrier"},{"FN":"economic integration"},{"FN":"commercial policy"},{"FN":"returns to scale"},{"FN":"comparative advantage"},{"FN":"international economics"},{"FN":"macroeconomics"},{"FN":"industrial organization"},{"FN":"international trade"},{"FN":"economic growth"},{"FN":"economics"}]},

If the country is unable to meet its debt service requirements out of current income, the creditors have two choices. They can finance the country, lending at an expected loss in the hope that the country will eventually be able to repay its debt after all; or they can forgive, reducing the debt level to one that the country can repay. The post-1983 debt strategy of the IMF and the US has relied on financing, but many current calls for debt reform call for forgiveness instead. The paper shows that the choice between financing and forgiveness represents a tradeoff. Financing gives the creditors an option value: if the country turns out to do relatively well, creditors will not have written down their claims unnecessarily. However, the burden of debt distorts the country's incentives, since the benefits of good performance go largely to creditors rather than itself. The paper also shows that the tradeoff itself can be improved if both financing and forgiveness are made contingent on states of nature that the country cannot affect, such as oil prices, world interest rates, etc.\",\"S\":[{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/2486.html\"}]}","AA":[{"AuN":"paul krugman","AuId":2012377754}],"F":[{"FN":"internal debt"},{"FN":"debt levels and flows"},{"FN":"debt to gdp ratio"},{"FN":"senior debt"},{"FN":"external debt"},{"FN":"actuarial science"},{"FN":"finance"},{"FN":"economic policy"},{"FN":"business"}]},

This paper develops a model which attempts to explain this observation, while at the same time making sense of some other puzzling empirical aspects of world trade. The basis of the model is a distinction between two kinds of trade: \\\"Heckscher-Ohlin\\\" trade, based on differences in factor proportions, and \\\"intraindustry\\\" trade, based on scale economies and product differentiation. To incorporate intraindustry trade into the model it is necessary to drop the usual assumptions of constant returns to scale and perfect competition; instead the paper deals with a world where economies of scale are pervasive and all firms possess some monopoly power. Surprisingly, it is nonetheless possible to develop a fully-worked-out general equilibrium model which remains simple and can be used to compare autarky and free trade. Two main results emerge from the analysis. First, the nature of trade depends on how similar countries are in their factor endowments. As countries become more similar, the trade between them will increasingly become intra-industry in character. Second, the effects of opening trade depend on its type. If intraindustry trade is sufficiently dominant the advantages of extending the market will outweigh the distributional effects, and the owners of scarce as well as of abundant factors will be made better off.\",\"S\":[{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w0356.pdf\"},{\"Ty\":3,\"U\":\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/nber_w0356.pdf?abstractid=260530&mirid=2\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w0356\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=260530&rec=1&srcabs=2288801&alg=7&pos=6\"},{\"Ty\":1,\"U\":\"https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/0356.html\"},{\"Ty\":0,\"U\":\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/nber_w0356.pdf?abstractid=260530&mirid=5\"}]}","AA":[{"AuN":"paul krugman","AuId":2012377754}],"F":[{"FN":"international free trade agreement"},{"FN":"international trade and water"},{"FN":"trade barrier"},{"FN":"economic integration"},{"FN":"commercial policy"},{"FN":"comparative advantage"},{"FN":"international economics"},{"FN":"international trade"},{"FN":"economics"}]},
